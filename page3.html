          <h3>CSS: Bringing the Web to Life</h3>
          <p>
             If HTML provides the structure, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) provides the beauty, organization, and visual flair.
             CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML, including colors,
             layouts, fonts, and the positioning of elements.

             The fundamental purpose of CSS is to separate the content (HTML) from the presentation (CSS).
             This separation is key to efficient web development, allowing you to update the entire look and feel of a website simply
             by modifying a few lines of CSS code, without touching the underlying HTML structure.
          </p>
      </section>

      <p>The most crucial architectural concept behind CSS is the separation of concerns—keeping the content (HTML) completely isolated from the style (CSS). 
         This separation is key to efficient web development, offering massive benefits. By modifying a single CSS file, developers can instantly update the entire visual theme of a large website, ensuring consistency and significantly improving maintainability. 
         This practice also results in cleaner HTML, which boosts performance and aids Search Engine Optimization (SEO).

          <h3>Understanding the Cascade and Selectors</h3>
          <p>The "C" in CSS stands for Cascading, which defines how styles are prioritized when conflicts occur.
             Styles can come from multiple sources (browser default, user, and your own stylesheet).
             The cascade uses a specific set of rules (Specificity, Importance, and Source Order) to determine which style declaration ultimately wins.

             The core of writing CSS is the use of selectors. These are patterns used to select the elements you want to style.
          </p>

          <ul>
             <li><strong>Element Selector:</strong> <code>p { color: blue; }</code> (Selects all paragraph tags)</li>
             <li><strong>Class Selector:</strong> <code>.btn-primary { background: green; }</code> (Selects elements with the class attribute btn-primary)</li>
             <li><strong>ID Selector:</strong> <code>#main-header { font-size: 24px; }</code> (Selects the single element with the ID main-header)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This cascading system ensures that styling is predictable and manageable. 
             Developers can set broad, general styles for the entire document (e.g., default font on the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>) and then confidently override them with highly specific styles for individual elements, creating a cohesive and well-organized visual design.

           alt="A diagram illustrating the CSS Box Model (Content, Padding, Border, Margin) with labeled arrows." 
           style="width:730px;height:400px; float:right; margin-right:20px;">

      <section>
          <h3>Layouts: The Box Model</h3>
          <p>
             Every element rendered by a browser, whether it's a paragraph or an image, is treated as a rectangular Box.
             Understanding the CSS Box Model is essential for controlling layout. The model consists of four layers, from the inside out:

             <br>
             <strong>Content:</strong> The actual text or image.<br>
             <strong>Padding:</strong> The space between the content and the border.<br>
             <strong>Border:</strong> The line that surrounds the padding and content.<br>
             <strong>Margin:</strong> The clear space outside the border, separating the element from other elements.
          </p>

          <ul>
              <li>CSS allows precise control of spacing, size, and relationship between elements.</li>
              <li>Techniques include Flexbox and Grid for advanced layouts.</li>
              <li>CSS can also handle responsiveness using media queries.</li>
          </ul>
      </section>

      <p>CSS is a vast and continuously evolving language.
         While initially simple to grasp, it offers deep control over interactivity through transitions, animations,
         and responsive design features like media queries.
         By separating concerns, you create code that is easier to maintain, faster to load, and adaptable to any screen size— from mobile phones to large desktop monitors.
