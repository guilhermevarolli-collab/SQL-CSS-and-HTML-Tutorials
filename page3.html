       <p>CSS: Bringing the Web to Life
         If HTML provides the structure, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) provides the beauty, organization, and visual flair. 
         CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML, including colors, layouts, fonts, and the positioning of elements.

The fundamental purpose of CSS is to separate the content (HTML) from the presentation (CSS). This separation is key to efficient web development, allowing you to update the entire look and feel of a website simply by modifying a few lines of CSS code, without touching the underlying HTML structure.</p>
