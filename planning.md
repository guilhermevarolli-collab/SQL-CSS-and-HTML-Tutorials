# SQL,CSS and HTML Tutorials
## Layout of the page
- Palet Colour:  
Some basic white and blue, nothing too fancy, something simple to make people pay attention on the content of the pages (**Maybe make some gradient here and there to give a little style for the pages, or even play with the colour, but always keeping it simple, make black and white, black and blue, blue and red. Something like that**).

### First page
- A big text with some image, maybe, to introduce the user (**Dimensions = 70%pxl for width and a 40%pxl height/Place = At the middle of the top**).  
- After this introduction, some more text and images, image to the left and the text to the right (**Dimensions = 25%pxl for width and a 30%pxl for height/Place = Under the first image, at the left of the page**).
- Complement the content with some text.
- Following the text, there will be 3 images explaining  the 3 themes, like a apresentation for the informations that will be presented. (**Dimensions = All of them will have the same dimensions, what will change it's where they will be placed [15%pxl wight and 20%pxl height]/Place = One image at the beginning of the page, at the left, one in the middle of the page, and one at the end of the page, right**).  
-And at the very end, a introduction video giving a brief of the 3 topics and summarizing all the informations already seen. (**Dimensions = 50%pxl wight and 30% height/Place = Middle center at the very bottom of the page**).  

(**ATTENTION**)  
The two last itens can change, like putting the video first and then the images with the brief.

### Second Page
- A big text with some image right in the middle of the text, maybe, to introduce the user (**Dimensions = 20%pxl for width and a 10%pxl height/Place = Right under the _HTML_ tittle, with the text**).  
- Another image to divide the text, so the user don't get bored with only text at their screen (**Dimensions = 40%pxl for width and a 20%pxl height/Place = Right under the _HTML_ tittle, after the text**).
- Some conclusion with more text and an example or tip.
- To give it a little bit of diference from the first page style structure, maybe a text in the middle of the page between to images, not sure what could be the content of the images and the text yet to justify that diferent design, i just want to make something characteristic for this page (**Dimensions = 20%pxl for width and a 60%pxl height/Place = One on the right of the page, one on the left, and the text in the middle**).
- After that, a little bit more of text and then summarzing all the informations with a video (**Dimensions = 60%pxl wight and 40% height/Place = Middle center almost at the very bottom of the page**)
- And for the last item, one little quiz to see if the user get it all the content presented in the previous tutorial (**Can be a link or something, still figuring out how to execute properly that ideia**).

### Third Page
- A image side by side with some introductory text, since we are talking about the _CSS_ topic, it would be good to give some image examples (**Dimensions = 30%pxl wight and 60% height/Place = The image will be on the left and the text on the right of the page**).
- Text to keep teaching the content.
- And another image in the same way done before, side by side with text (**Dimensions = 30%pxl wight and 60% height/Place = The image will be on the right and the text on the left of the page this time**).
- Some text to complete the topic and after that the video to summarize the informations seen before (**Dimensions = 60%pxl wight and 40% height/Place = Middle center almost at the very bottom of the page**).
- And then, the quiz to finish all.



### Fourth page
(**ATTENTION**)  
**EXTRA, NOT NEEDED FOR THE PROJECT**

- Start with some introductory text, followed by an image to ilustrate everthing said on the text (**Dimensions = 20%pxl for width and a 10%pxl height/Place = Right before the _SQL_ tittle, after the text**).
- Some more text to complement.
- A image side by side with an image after, to complement the information prensented before (**Dimensions = 30%pxl wight and 60% height/Place = The image will be on the right and the text on the left of the page**).
- Some more text to finish the topic.
- After that, the video and the quiz to finish all the website and summarize the _SQL_ topic (**Dimensions = 60%pxl wight and 40% height/Place = Middle center almost at the very bottom of the page**).
