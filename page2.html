       <p>Introduction to HTML

HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, is the foundation of every website on the internet. Everything you see on a webpage—text, images, buttons, links, forms—begins as HTML. It serves as the structural skeleton of a site, defining the layout and hierarchy of content before CSS or JavaScript add styling and interactivity.
Learning HTML is the first essential step toward understanding how the web works. Whether you want to build full websites, work with front-end development, or simply understand online structures better, HTML is where it all begins.
In this tutorial, you’ll learn the fundamental building blocks of HTML, how to structure a webpage properly, and how to write clean and efficient markup from start to finish.

      <p>Now that you understand the basic idea of what HTML does, you’re already capable of building simple pages and seeing them come to life in your browser. A great beginner habit is to keep your code clean by using indentation and comments to document what each part of the page does.

      <p>The Importance of Semantics in HTML

As you continue learning, it’s not enough just to use HTML; you need to use semantic HTML. Semantics means choosing the right tags for the right purpose, making your page more accessible, better structured, and easier to understand for search engines.

Examples of semantic structure:

<header> for top sections

<main> for the primary content

<nav> for navigation menus

<section> and <article> for organized content blocks

<footer> for the bottom information of the page

Semantic HTML is a key step toward writing clean, professional-quality code.
</p>
   
   <p>You now have a solid understanding of HTML basics—structure, tags, and semantics. With these tools, you’re fully prepared to start building complete webpages and later enhance them with CSS styling and JavaScript functionality.
