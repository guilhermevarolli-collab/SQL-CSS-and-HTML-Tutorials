       <h3>HTML: The Foundation of the World Wide Web</h3>

       <p>
          HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the essential building block of all websites. 
          It provides the structure and meaning to your content, organizing text, images, and links so web browsers can display them correctly. 
          Without HTML, there is no webpage. It is the language that defines what every element on the screen is (e.g., a heading, a paragraph, a list, or a button).
       </p>
      

      <img src="image folder/html page image 1.jpg"
      alt="Code of HTML an any example"
      style="width:1200px;height:400px;">

      <p>Essential Structure: The HTML Boilerplate
         Every well-formed HTML document must start with a basic structure, often called the "boilerplate."
         This ensures compatibility and proper rendering across all browsers.
         The most crucial tags are <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, 
         <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> 
         contains metadata (like the page title and links to CSS), while the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> 
         contains all the visible content.

         <br><br>
         <strong>Tip: Semantic HTML</strong> — Always use the correct tag for the content you are presenting.
         For example, use <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for the main title, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> for a paragraph,
         and <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> for navigation links. Using semantic HTML not only makes your code cleaner
         and more readable but also significantly improves accessibility and SEO.
      </p>
      
   <div class="html-section">

    <img src="image folder/html page image 2.png"
         alt="A webpage with HTML and CSS"
         class="side-img">

       <p class="center-text">
           HTML focuses solely on defining the meaning.
           It is the core content layer. Many beginners mistakenly try
           to style elements using old HTML attributes (like align="center"), 
           but modern web development demands that all styling and visual layout 
           be managed exclusively by CSS. The true power of HTML lies in its 
           ability to nest elements correctly, creating a clear hierarchy that 
           can be styled powerfully and consistently by a separate stylesheet.
       </p>

       <img src="image folder/html page image 3.png"
            alt="A webpage with HTML but not CSS"
            class="side-img">
   </div>


      

   
      <p>Ultimately, mastering HTML is about mastering the language of content organization.
         Your goal is to define content using the most appropriate tags possible.
         As you advance, you will learn about forms, media embedding 
         (<code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>), and using advanced APIs,
         all of which are anchored by the fundamental structure provided by HTML5.
