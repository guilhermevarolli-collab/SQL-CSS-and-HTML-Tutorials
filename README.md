## Layout of the page
- Palet Colour:  
Some basic white and blue, nothing too fancing, somethin simple to make people pay attention on the content of the pages (**Maybe make some gradient here an there to give a little style for the pages, or even play with the colour, but always keeping it simple, make black and white, black and blue, blue and red. Something like that**).

### First page
- A big text with some images, maybe, to introduce the user (**Dimensions = 70%pxl for width and a 40%pxl height/Place = At the middle of the top**).  
- After this introduction, some more text and images, displayed the image to the left and the text to the right (**Dimensions = 25%pxl for width and a 30%pxl for height/Place = Under the first image, at the left of the page**).
- Complement the content with some text.
- Following the text, there will be 3 images explaining  the 3 themes, like a summary to the informations presented before. (**Dimensions = All of them will have the same dimensions, what will change it's where they will be placed [15%pxl wight and 20%pxl height]/Place = One image at the beginning of the page, at the left, one in the middle of the page, and one at the end of the page, right**).
-And at the very end, a introduction video giving a brief of the 3 topics and summarizing all the informations already seen. (**Dimensions = 50%pxl wight and 30% height/Place = Middle center at the very bottom of the page**).  

(**ATTENTION**)  
The two last itens can change, like putting the video first and then the images with the brief.

### Second Page
- A big text with some images, maybe, to introduce the user (**Dimensions = 20%pxl for width and a 10%pxl height/Place = Right under the _HTML_ tittle, with the text**).  
- Another image to divide the text, so the user don't get bored with only text at their screen (**Dimensions = 40%pxl for width and a 20%pxl height/Place = Right under the _HTML_ tittle, with the text**).
