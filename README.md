# HTML & CSS Personal Website

## Overview

This project is a personal website built entirely with **HTML5** and **CSS3**, featuring explanations, practical examples, and visual demonstrations of the two foundational pillars of web development.

The primary goal is to showcase my practical knowledge and demonstrate proficiency in:

- Semantic structure
- Navigation
- Tables, lists, and forms
- Layout and visual organization

---

## Project Purpose

This website serves as a small educational portfolio, highlighting:

- Understanding of HTML structure
- Modern CSS implementation
- Correct usage of **classes**, **IDs**, and **pseudo-classes**
- Clean visual organization
- Beginner-friendly explanatory content

It also served as a practice in **planning, design, responsiveness, and coding best practices**.

## Planning & Documentation

Before starting the implementation, the project went through a detailed planning phase:

1. **Wireframes & Layout Sketches**  
   Created rough sketches of the main page, HTML page, CSS page, and form to plan structure and content flow.

2. **Content Organization**  
   Decided which HTML elements to use for headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and forms.

3. **HTML/CSS Evolution Discussion**  
   - **HTML** has evolved from simple text markup to a semantic and structured language.  
   - **CSS** has grown from basic inline styles to modern layouts using **Flexbox**, **Grid**, and **media queries** for responsiveness.  


5. **Design Considerations**  
   - Color scheme and typography consistency  
   - Visual hierarchy of headings and sections  
   - Responsive layout planning for mobile and desktop  
   - Interactive elements like hover effects and links
