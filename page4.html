      <p>SQL: The Language of Data Management
         While HTML and CSS build the face of the web (the front-end), SQL (Structured Query Language) is the essential tool
         for managing and interacting with the data on the back-end. SQL is the standard language for relational database
         management systems (RDBMS). It is used to perform tasks such as updating, retrieving, creating, and deleting data
         from a database.

         Think of a database as a massive, organized filing cabinet, and SQL as the language you use to ask precise questions
         to retrieve, insert, or change information efficiently and securely.

      <p>The Four Fundamental Commands
         SQL is categorized into different types of commands, but developers primarily focus on DML (Data Manipulation Language).
         The most crucial operations—often summarized by the acronym CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)—are executed using four
         main keywords:

         <br><br>
         <strong>SELECT:</strong> Used to Read (retrieve) data from the database. (The most common command).<br>
         <strong>INSERT:</strong> Used to Create (add) new records (rows) into a table.<br>
         <strong>UPDATE:</strong> Used to Update (modify) existing records in a table.<br>
         <strong>DELETE:</strong> Used to Delete existing records from a table.<br><br>

         Mastering the syntax of these four commands is the first and most critical step in becoming proficient with SQL.
      </p>

      

      <h3>The Power of the SELECT Command</h3>
      <p>
          The **<code>SELECT</code>** command is the main tool for getting data out of a database. 
         You use it to pick specific columns (e.g., <code>SELECT name, email</code>) and then use the **<code>WHERE</code>** clause to filter the rows (e.g., <code>WHERE age > 30</code>). 
         The **<code>ORDER BY</code>** clause lets you sort the results (e.g., <code>ORDER BY name ASC</code>).

      <h3>Linking Data with JOINs</h3>
      <p>
          Databases store related data in separate tables to keep things organized. 
         **<code>JOIN</code>s** are essential for temporarily linking these tables together. 
         The most common type is the **<code>INNER JOIN</code>**, which only shows rows that have a match in both tables (e.g., showing only customers who actually placed an order). 
      </p>

      <h3>Summarizing Data</h3>
      <p>
         SQL is powerful for summarizing data. 
         **Aggregate functions** like <code>SUM()</code>, <code>AVG()</code>, and <code>COUNT()</code> perform math on your data. 
         You use the **<code>GROUP BY</code>** clause to run these calculations for specific categories (e.g., grouping sales by region to find the average sale amount per region).
      </p>

      <h3>SQL's Role</h3>
      <p>
         SQL is not just for small websites; it is the **universal language** for almost all large applications, including banking, e-commerce, and data analysis systems. 
         Mastering SQL provides a foundational skill that is essential across nearly every technology and data career.
