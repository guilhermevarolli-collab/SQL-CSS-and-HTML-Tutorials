       <h3>Welcome to the CSS, SQL, and HTML tutorials.</h3>
       Here you will learn everything you need to be a master at HTML, CSS, and SQL.
       On this webpage there will be 4 pages to explain every topic to you; this is the first page, which is just a brief for you to set you up in this world of code and numbers.
       The next page, the first topic, will be a page dedicated to HTML, giving you every possible piece of information that you might need to understand and use HTML in your web development and in your professional career.
       The third page will give you everything that you need to understand about CSS: how to use it, how to understand it, how to work with it, and all the good stuff.
       And for the fourth and final page, an SQL tutorial to show how to use and manipulate data in the best way possible for your needs.
       So let's for funny part know!

          Welcome to Your Starting Point in Web and Data Development!  
          You are about to dive into the three most fundamental languages that support the modern internet.
          This course is designed to transform the complexity of coding into clear, practical steps that anyone can follow.
          We will go far beyond theory: you will learn how to build, style, and manage the digital core of any project.
      </p>

      <p> As you progress, you will begin to understand not only how code works, but why it works.
          You’ll explore how HTML forms the structure of every webpage, how CSS brings style, identity, and visual refinement,
          and how SQL empowers websites and applications to store, retrieve, and analyze information with precision.
          Each lesson will strengthen your confidence, allowing you to create pages, interfaces, and systems that look and feel professional — even if you are a complete beginner.
      </p>
      
      <p>Throughout this journey, you will also develop a true problem-solving mindset.
         Programming is not about memorizing commands; it is about understanding logic, patterns, and thinking in structured steps.
         The more you practice, the more natural it becomes — and soon you will realize that coding is less about “typing instructions”
         and more about creating solutions.
      </p>
      
      <p>Whatever your goal - creating your own portfolio, launching a blog, or starting a career as a junior developer - mastering HTML, CSS, and SQL is your passport to success.
      </p>
      
      <p>These three technologies are the foundation of almost everything on the web.
         Once you understand them, you will be fully prepared to expand into modern frameworks, powerful libraries, and deeper areas of development such as full-stack programming, data analysis, cloud computing, or even mobile app development.
      </p>

      <p>You are not just learning syntax — you are learning a new way to communicate with machines,
         a new way to express ideas, and a new way to build digital experiences from the ground up.
         Every line of code you write brings you one step closer to becoming the developer you want to be.
         Whether your dream is to work for a major tech company, build your own projects, or simply understand how the digital world works, this course will be a defining milestone in your journey.
      </p>

      <p>Get your code editor ready
         Your adventure starts now — and the digital creations you imagine are about to come to life.

      <h3>Why Learn the Fundamentals?</h3>
      <p>   
         In a rapidly evolving tech ecosystem, HTML, CSS, and SQL remain the backbone of almost all software and websites. They are the solid foundation that allows you to learn any more advanced framework or programming language in the future (such as JavaScript, React, Python, etc.). By mastering these tools, you don't just code, but you also understand how the web truly works beneath the surface. This ensures your solutions are robust, performant, and scalable. Start with the essentials and build a future-proof career.

        <p>HTML: The Structure  
          Start by building the skeleton of your page. Learn to use tags and elements to organize headings, paragraphs, lists, and media. HTML is the logical foundation for all your content.

        <a href="page3.html"><img src="image folder/index image number 3.png" alt="CSS characteristics" style="width:300px;height:300px;"></a>
        <p>CSS: The Style  
          Bring your project to life. Master stylesheets to control colors, fonts, spacing, and, crucially, responsive layout. Transform simple documents into impactful visual interfaces.

       <h3>Conclusion and Overview: How HTML, CSS, and SQL Work Together</h3> 
       <p> 
          We have reached the end of this introduction. This video is your point of consolidation, where we bring together the three pillars you've just learned about. Watch a practical summary of how HTML (the structure), CSS (the style), and SQL (the data) complement each other, forming the functional foundation of any web application. It is the complete 360-degree view you need to begin your studies with clarity and purpose.
          Down here, a little video to set you in for the big jurney that we will still have.
