      <h3>Welcome to the CSS, SQL, and HTML tutorials.</h3>
      Here you will learn everything you need to be a master at HTML, CSS, and SQL.
       On this webpage there will be 4 pages to explain every topic to you; this is the first page, which is just a brief for you to set you up in this world of code and numbers.
       The next page, the first topic, will be a page dedicated to HTML, giving you every possible piece of information that you might need to understand and use HTML in your web development and in your professional career.
       The third page will give you everything that you need to understand about CSS: how to use it, how to understand it, how to work with it, and all the good stuff.
       And for the fourth and final page, an SQL tutorial to show how to use and manipulate data in the best way possible for your needs.

      <p>Welcome to Your Starting Point in Web and Data Development!  
         
          You are about to dive into the three most fundamental languages that underpin the modern internet. This course is designed to transform the complexity of coding into simple, practical steps. We will go far beyond theory: you will learn how to build, style, and manage the digital core of any project.
          Whatever your goal — creating your own portfolio, launching a blog, or starting a career as a junior developer — mastering HTML (the structure), CSS (the design), and SQL (the data) is your passport to success. Get your code editor ready. The journey to bringing your ideas to life begins now.
      </p>
      
      <p>Why Learn the Fundamentals?  
         
         In a rapidly evolving tech ecosystem, HTML, CSS, and SQL remain the backbone of almost all software and websites. They are the solid foundation that allows you to learn any more advanced framework or programming language in the future (such as JavaScript, React, Python, etc.). By mastering these tools, you don't just code, but you also understand how the web truly works beneath the surface. This ensures your solutions are robust, performant, and scalable. Start with the essentials and build a future-proof career.

       <p>HTML: The Structure  
         
          Start by building the skeleton of your page. Learn to use tags and elements to organize headings, paragraphs, lists, and media. HTML is the logical foundation for all your content.

       <p>SQL: The Data  
         
          Understand how information is stored and accessed. Learn to query (SELECT), insert (INSERT), and update (UPDATE) data in a database. SQL is the key to the back-end of any application.
